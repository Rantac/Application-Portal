## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Midnight blue (#2C3E50) for a professional and sophisticated feel, referencing the 'darker overall background'.
- Background color: Very dark blue (#242B36), nearly black, to emphasize content cards, and to match user's 'darker overall background' and 'frosted glass effect' for the content cards. Chosen to complement the primary color without overshadowing it.
- Accent color: Electric purple (#BE29EC) to provide a sharp contrast against the dark background and draw attention to interactive elements. It provides a vibrant visual pop that complements the midnight blue while maintaining a sense of modernity. It is analogous to midnight blue.
- Clean, sans-serif font for category names, in white for readability against the dark backdrop.
- Colorful, recognizable logos for each category positioned in the top-right of the content cards.
- Grid-based layout with rounded rectangular cards and a semi-transparent background effect, offering a clear and engaging user experience.
- Subtle hover animations to reveal edit and delete icons.
